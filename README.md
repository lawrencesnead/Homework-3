Description: This is a basic website I developed for practice and utility using bootstrap. It is a relatively simple script that generates a password between 8 and 128 characters from 4 different character lists of your choosing. It also features a sticky footer and CSS Styling.

Usage: Follow the prompts. Be sure to select at least 1 of the 4 character types and a password length between 8 and 128. Once complete, hit the generate password button to see your password. If you desire, there is a button to copy it to your clipboard.
